Time Complexity:-
 
 In this process, we are computing values in the array matrix but only half of them.
 Since we are performing chain multiplications of these matrices in the order of 2, 3 and so on,
 
 Therefore, we are generating n(n-1)/2 elements. For each element, we are calculating all values and finding the minimum
 out of them, which would be done at most n times.
 
 Hence, n(n-1)/2 * n --> which gives us the time complexity of O(n^3).
